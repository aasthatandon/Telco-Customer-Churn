# Telco Customer Churn

### Problem Statement : 
Telecom operators face the critical challenge of customer churn, where losing existing customers results in revenue loss, while acquiring new customers is costly. To address this, the project aims to develop an accurate churn prediction model utilizing customer characteristics. This model will assist telecom companies in identifying customers at high risk of churning, enabling targeted retention efforts and revenue protection.

### Project Description : 
This project encompasses the development of a churn prediction system tailored for telecom operators, starting with comprehensive data preprocessing. Customer data, including demographics and usage patterns, is explored, cleansed and engineered for analysis. Multiple machine learning models like k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest, Boosted Trees and Logistic Regression are trained and validated using historical data. Performance metrics (like accuracy) guides model selection. Comparative analysis highlighted the most suitable model, ensuring effective customer retention strategies. The project culminated in a detailed report, offering insights into model selection, training, validation, and performance comparison, facilitating enhanced churn management.
